      This script is the entry point for our frontend application.
      - `type="module"` enables modern JavaScript import/export syntax.
      - Modules are implicitly "deferred", meaning the script is downloaded in parallel
        and executed only after the HTML document has been fully parsed. This is
        great for performance as it doesn't block the page from rendering.
      - Placing it at the end of `<body>` is a best practice for the same reason.
