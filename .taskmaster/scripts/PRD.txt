BiocBot — Product Requirements Document

1 Why BiocBot Exists
BiocBot is a 24/7 chatbot learning tool set to be piloted in BIOC 202. It is designed around the protégé–instructor dynamic, where students deepen their understanding by actively asking questions, thinking aloud, and teaching concepts back. BiocBot uses AI to deliver helpful, trustworthy responses by drawing only from instructor-approved course material.This approach was first tested in person, and BiocBot now brings it into a chatbot format. By giving students access to trusted, instructor-approved support anytime they need it, the goal is to make studying more interactive, personalized, and approachable

2 Key Benefits 
Students get quick, trustworthy help, with clear links back to official course materials
“Teach-back” mode helps students catch misunderstandings early by explaining concepts in their own words
Expands the reach of the current study-buddy program by making it accessible to all students, 24/7

E.g “Last time we discussed Hydrogen bonds and you really understood xxxxx topic well. Today we will talk about xx topic 
Text input field for students to type and respond
A persistent disclaimer about personal information and messages being sent to an LLM model
Mode toggle will be in the bottom right corner that allows students to switch between protegee or teacher mode

There would also be a how to page that would give them some tips and information

4 Modes of Interaction
4.1 Calibration Quiz
Lists learning objectives per sessions 
X amount of probe questions on each session to determine the mode (Student as teacher or student as learner), generated from uploaded or auto-generated material
Instructor-provided questions or auto-generated if none imputed 
Based on a metric set by the instructor regarding the number of correct responses, the student is set to the Protégé mode(“Student as learner”); otherwise Tutor mode(“Student as teacher”)
4.2 Student as Protégé Mode 
BiocBot acts as a teacher, teaching concepts and leading the conversation
BiocBot will present topics and ask a series of questions about the material
Students will be allowed to ask about concepts they are unfamiliar with 
Questions and responses will be generated by LLM using Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure questions are within course material scope
In the event that a question being asked is out of scope:
E.g "That's a great question! It seems to go beyond the topics covered today. I recommend checking with your instructor or exploring additional resources. Let me know if you’d like help with anything related to the course material!"
End of session the bot will ask the student to summarize lesson for the day 
Inform students what areas they did well on (can be a learning objective) and areas of focus  
4.3 Student as Tutor Mode  
Student will act as a teacher, leading the conversation in providing answers 
BiocBot will act as a student, asking questions about the current unit’s topics
Questions and responses will be generated by LLM using Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure questions are within course material scope for the given week

Concepts 
Types of Questions: 
Concept questions 
Created using LLM and given as a text response 
Calculation questions 
Created using Latex 
Drawing questions 
Can utilize chemfig, or will utilize prompts to have in-line drawings from the bot
Follow-up questions intended to guide improvement in student answers
Toward the end of the session the bot will ask students to create some quick questions on concepts as a summary exercise
E.g “Hey I think I get it now! Could you please ask me some questions to make sure that I fully understand, and I’d love some feedback on my answers”
Prompts will be provided to help formulate questions
